## Project Proposal

### Data and Audience

What is the dataset you’ll be working with?

* The data set describes the academic performance of students at two Portuguese schools. More specifically, the data sets measure student performance in two distinct categories: mathematics and Portuguese language. The sampling specifically targets two secondary schools: Gabriel Periera (GP) and Mousinho da Silveira (MS). My group and I found the data set published on Kaggle, a platform designed for data scientists and machine learning practices to publish data. However, the data set originates from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and was collected by Prof. Paulo Cortez at the Department of Information Systems. 

Who is your target audience?

* Given that the dataset revolves around student performance, the audiences interested in the dataset include students, educators, and school administrators.

What does your audience want to learn from your data?

* From the data, the audience is interested in seeing how various factors, both inside and outside of the home, affect student performance. Understanding these various factors in isolation will demonstrate which ones are academic performance indicators. 

* Questions we are intrested in exploring into: 
  * Does the student’s mother’s and father’s occupation have a correlation to student performance? 
  * Is a parent's education level an indicator of student's academic success? 
  * Do students in urban areas perform better in school than students from rural areas? 

### Technical Description

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

* We will be reading our data through .csv files.

What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

* We may have to reshape our data (ex. change bar plots) when we get more data.

What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

* We will most likely use the common libraries that we learned in class.


What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?

* We will be answering with statistical analysis because we want to monitor the correlation between the variables and student success


What major challenges do you anticipate?

* Some major challenges we anticipate are making it interactive with the user and continuously updating the data to help user get the most up-to-date information
